# NISEI Deck Builder (beta)
A single-page application to help players of NISEI/Netrunner build their decks. 

## Description

NISEI/Netrunner is a fun collectible card game (with an interesting publication history). With over 2,000 cards, building your own deck can be pretty intimidating. I designed this app to make that process a bit easier.

With the deck builder, you can search among the game's existing cards, create and delete your own decks, add/remove cards, and search within the decks.

The project is currently in beta and I'd appreciate any feedback!

## Installation
The current version of the app simulates a server for storing deck information using [JSON-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
If you have any questions about the app or suggestions, please send me an email at tim.loughrist@gmail.com.

## Roadmap
1. The styling of the app needs to be cleaned up considerably.
2. Display information about the active deck, e.g., number of cards, faction, agenda points, etc.
3. Validate whether the deck is legal.

## Contributing
If anyone wants to fork this repo and work on the app, I'd love to see what you do with it!

## Authors and acknowledgment
I've been lucky to have the help of instructors at the Flatiron coding bootcamp. I've also benefited greatly from running code past my friend, Patrick Lindsay.
